The UF2 project assigns the [family](https://github.com/microsoft/uf2/blob/master/utils/uf2families.json) definition for the UV-K5 (V3) device as follows:

```json
{
    "id": "0x7d7a66ef",
    "short_name": "PY32F071-UVK5-V3",
    "description": "Quansheng UV-K5 V3 amateur radio based on Puya Semiconductor PY32F071"
}
```

Moto adheres to this definition, which means UF2 tools can automatically detect Moto virtual disks and perform certain actions accordingly.
