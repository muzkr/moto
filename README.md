# Moto: Modern Bootloader for Quansheng UV-K5 (V3) and UV-K1 Radios

Moto (Japanese “もと / 元”, meaning “origin”) is a modern bootloader that mounts the radio as a USB disk on a computer, providing a drag-and-drop user experience for firmware and data updates and backups.

This project is currently in the early development phase but preview releases are available for users to test and evaluate (just find them in the Discussions section). Simply flash Moto as regular firmware to the radio, and you're good to go.

## Features

- Mount the internal flash (which stores the firmware) or data storage as a USB disk
- FAT file system
- UF2 firmware file format
